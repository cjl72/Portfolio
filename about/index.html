        Hello, my name is Connor Letko and I am currently a sophomore at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
        I was home schooled up until high school.  This taught me many things about how to work not on restricted time.
        I attended North Hunterdon High School in Annandale, New Jersey.  I have been working for Global Healthcare Management
        for around 6 years.  I have recently started working for a new company named PUlse Innovations.  There I am
        working on developing RFID technology applications to bring to market.  I am majoring in Web Information Systems
        out of NJIT.  I hope this website can serve as an opportunity for employers to see my skills, as well as learn more about me.
        Then use the contact for to get in contact with me if wanted.
